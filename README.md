# NovaMesh: Ethereum & Solana DeSci Application

This full-stack DeSci application is a...

## Overview

### Ethereum

* The `Next.js` framework for creating modern, performant React applications using server-side rendering.
* `Tailwind CSS` utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces
* The `RainbowKit` React library that provides a customizable and easy-to-integrate user interface for connecting and interacting with Ethereum wallets in decentralized applications.
* The `Wagmi` React library provides a collection of hooks for managing Ethereum-related states and actions, simplifying the process of interacting with Ethereum smart contracts and wallets in web applications.
* Both the `Foundry` and `Hardhat` smart contract development toolchains that provides a fast, modular, and extensible framework for building, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts.
* Hardhat ignition modules for deployment. `Mocha` testing framework and `Chai` assertion library.
* Solidity scripts for deployment and Solidity tests with cheat codes.
* Mock contracts used for testing on local blockchain nodes.
* ERC20 Token & ERC721 NFT
* `Ethers.js` library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem
* `Etherscan` Verification
* `Alchemy` node as a service provides RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
* `OpenZeppelin` library for secure smart contract development
* `Chainlink` decentralized oracle network for connecting smart contracts with real-world data
* `Pinata` API used to upload NFT artwork and metadata to IPFS
* `Makefile` is used to streamline the development process, allowing both Foundry and Hardhat commands to be simultaneously with a single custom command.

### Solana

* `Solana Wallet Adapter` facilitated wallet connection
* `Anchor` framework for developing, testing, and deploying Solana smart contracts
* The `Mocha` testing framework and `Chai` assertion library
